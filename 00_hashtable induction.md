## excercise : Try to find the math test result for students
- backgroud
  Molly's school recently publishe their middle term results, every students want to know their 
- known facts
  - the result is a list with two columns: student name and their scores
  - size of list bigger than 100,000
  - download the data in [math result]()
  - student name consist of lower english letters only, from 'a' to 'u'
  - and there are no identical names
  - the length of the student names <=10
-  task 1:
  - requirement:try serveral different student name for test
  - input:
    - one line if string which tells the student name
  - output:
    - two line of decimals:
      -  first line:score of the student
      -  second line: time eclipsed in millimun second
- task 2:
  -  thinking : what decide the time eclipsed? randomly?
  -  any way to improve the algorithm
- task 3:
  - requirement: find the score of any student with 1s
  - input:
    - one line if string which tells the student name
  - output:
    - two line of decimals:
      -  first line:score of the student
      -  second line: time eclipsed in millimun second

## this is what we call direct addreessing
- what is the limitable of algorithm?
  - what if their name consist of both Uper and Lower letter and numbers, with the length of less than 15?
      - size of target set vs
      - size of memory need to allocate?

## One possible soltions to resovle the issue: hash table
